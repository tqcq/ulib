# Database Connectors

Using sqlpp11 requires of three logical parts:
1. The actual tables of a database are represented structs, usually generated by sql2cpp. These structs contain compile-time information about each colum such as name and data type.
2. The core library provides SQL as embedded language for C++. It allows you to write SQL statements for those tables and analyse results in a compile-time checked manner.
3. The connector library that allows you to connect to an actual database, send queries and obtain results.

Three connector libraries are included in this repository:

  * MySQL / MariaDB
  * sqlite3 / SQLCipher
  * PostgreSQL

If you want to use other databases, you would have to write your own connector. Don't worry, it is not that hard.

The api is documented [here](https://github.com/rbock/sqlpp11/blob/master/connector_api/connection.h).
